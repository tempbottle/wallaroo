# Word count with dynamic keys

## About The Application

This is an example application that receives strings of text, splits it into individual words and counts the occurrences of each word. Each word is stored as a separate piece of state.

### Input

The inputs of the "Word Count With Dynamic Keys" application are strings encoded in the [source message framing protocol](https://docs.wallaroolabs.com/book/appendix/tcp-decoders-and-encoders.html#framed-message-protocols#source-message-framing-protocol). Here's an example of an input message, written as a Python string:

```
"\x00\x00\x00\x4cMy solitude is cheered by that elegant hope."
```

`\x00\x00\x00\x2c` -- four bytes representing the number of bytes in the payload

`My solitude is cheered by that elegant hope.` -- the payload

### Output

The messages are strings terminated with a newline, with the form `WORD => COUNT` where `WORD` is the word and `COUNT` is the number of times that word has been seen. Each incoming message may generate zero or more output messages, one for each word in the input.

### Processing

The `decoder` function turns the input message into a string. That string is then passed to the `split` one-to-many computation, which breaks the string into individual words and returns a list containing these words. Each item in the list is sent as a separate message to the partition function which determines which state partition it will go to. At each partition, the word and the `WordTotals` state object for that partition are sent to the `count_word` state computation, which updates word's count by 1, and returns the current count for this word as its output. That count is then sent to the `encoder` function with formats it for output.

## Running Word Count With Dynamic Keys

In order to run the application you will need Machida, Giles Sender, and the Cluster Shutdown tool. We provide instructions for building these tools yourself and we provide prebuilt binaries within a Docker container. Please visit our [setup](https://docs.wallaroolabs.com/book/getting-started/choosing-an-installation-option.html) instructions to choose one of these options if you have not already done so.

You will need three separate shells to run this application. Open each shell and go to the `examples/python/word_count_with_dynamic_keys` directory.

### Shell 1: Metrics

Start up the Metrics UI if you don't already have it running:

```bash
docker start mui
```

You can verify it started up correctly by visiting [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000).

If you need to restart the UI, run:

```bash
docker restart mui
```

When it's time to stop the UI, run:

```bash
docker stop mui
```

If you need to start the UI after stopping it, run:

```bash
docker start mui
```

### Shell 2: Data Receiver

Set `PATH` to refer to the directory that contains the `data_receiver` executable. Assuming you installed Wallaroo according to the tutorial instructions you would do:

**Note:** If running in Docker, the `PATH` variable is pre-set for you to include the necessary directories to run this example.

```bash
export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/wallaroo-tutorial/wallaroo/machida/build:$HOME/wallaroo-tutorial/wallaroo/giles/sender:$HOME/wallaroo-tutorial/wallaroo/utils/data_receiver:$HOME/wallaroo-tutorial/wallaroo/utils/cluster_shutdown"
```

Run Data Receiver to listen for TCP output on `127.0.0.1` port `7002`:

```bash
data_receiver --ponythreads=1 --ponynoblock \
  --listen 127.0.0.1:7002
```

### Shell 3: Word Count With Dynamic Keys

Set `PATH` to refer to the directory that contains the `machida` executable. Set `PYTHONPATH` to refer to the current directory (where `word_count_with_dynamic_keys.py` is) and the `machida` directory (where `wallaroo.py` is). Assuming you installed Wallaroo according to the tutorial instructions you would do:

**Note:** If running in Docker, the `PATH` and `PYTHONPATH` variables are pre-set for you to include the necessary directories to run this example.

```bash
export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/wallaroo-tutorial/wallaroo/machida/build:$HOME/wallaroo-tutorial/wallaroo/giles/sender:$HOME/wallaroo-tutorial/wallaroo/utils/data_receiver:$HOME/wallaroo-tutorial/wallaroo/utils/cluster_shutdown"
export PYTHONPATH="$PYTHONPATH:.:$HOME/wallaroo-tutorial/wallaroo/machida"
```

Run `machida` with `--application-module word_count_with_dynamic_keys`:

```bash
machida --application-module word_count_with_dynamic_keys \
  --in 127.0.0.1:7010 --out 127.0.0.1:7002 \
  --metrics 127.0.0.1:5001 --control 127.0.0.1:6000 --data 127.0.0.1:6001 \
  --name worker-name --external 127.0.0.1:5050 --cluster-initializer \
  --ponythreads=1 --ponynoblock
```

### Shell 4: Sender

Set `PATH` to refer to the directory that contains the `sender`  executable. Assuming you installed Wallaroo according to the tutorial instructions you would do:

**Note:** If running in Docker, the `PATH` variable is pre-set for you to include the necessary directories to run this example.

```bash
export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/wallaroo-tutorial/wallaroo/machida/build:$HOME/wallaroo-tutorial/wallaroo/giles/sender:$HOME/wallaroo-tutorial/wallaroo/utils/data_receiver:$HOME/wallaroo-tutorial/wallaroo/utils/cluster_shutdown"
```
Send messages:

```bash
sender --host 127.0.0.1:7010 --file count_this.txt \
  --batch-size 5 --interval 100_000_000 --messages 10000000 \
  --ponythreads=1 --ponynoblock --repeat --no-write
```

## Reading the Output

There will be a stream of output messages in the Shell 2.

## Shell 5: Shutdown

Set `PATH` to refer to the directory that contains the `cluster_shutdown` executable. Assuming you installed Wallaroo  according to the tutorial instructions you would do:

**Note:** If running in Docker, the `PATH` variable is pre-set for you to include the necessary directories to run this example.

```bash
export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/wallaroo-tutorial/wallaroo/machida/build:$HOME/wallaroo-tutorial/wallaroo/giles/sender:$HOME/wallaroo-tutorial/wallaroo/utils/data_receiver:$HOME/wallaroo-tutorial/wallaroo/utils/cluster_shutdown"
```

You can shut down the Wallaroo cluster with this command once processing has finished:

```bash
cluster_shutdown 127.0.0.1:5050
```

You can shut down Giles Sender and Data Receiver by pressing `Ctrl-c` from their respective shells.

You can shut down the Metrics UI with the following command:

```bash
docker stop mui
```
